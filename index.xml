            instructions for authenticating with Spotify, then fetching lyrics,  and connecting to the Watson APIs on Bluemix.

        <!-- INTRODUCTORY VIDEO - OPTIONAL 
 For authors:  Optionally, develop a short video of yourself introducing the app you wrote 
 and perhaps demonstrating it on your computer or mobile device.  Send the video source 
 to your developerWorks editor.
 For editors:  If the author submits a video, follow the separate instructions on adding a
 thumbnail image, transcript, and closed-captions for the video on the developerWorks

        <!-- START OF ARTICLE BODY   
For authors: Your article can contain paragraphs, major headings, minor
headings, code listings, images, tables, sidebars, lists, highlighting, and 
"quoted" content in a larger font ("pull quotes"). 

DO NOT copy or cut and paste text from word processors such as 
Microsoft Word. The encoding method they use (even if UTF-8) creates 
invalid characters in the XML. Instead, save the Word document 
as a text file and then copy the text.  -->

            <!--For authors: On writing style. As you compose your article, aim for a
conversational style, including the purpose of the app, why you chose the tools, 
frameworks, languages, etc. you did, and how you developed the app, including 
relevant instructional information about the tools, frameworks, languages, etc. 
you used.  Don't overdo it.  You can make assumptions that the reader has some 
level of these skills, and should state those assumptions in the article.  Your purpose 
should be to teach a fellow developer how to develop a similar app using services 
in BlueMix and how to contribute to further development of your app on JazzHub.  
You should present your material in easy-to-follow steps and include relevant 
screen captures and code snippets.  Short, to-the-point articles are best.  We can 
string multiple articles together in an easy-to-consume set, if necessary.-->

            <!-- PARAGRAPH 
 For authors: Every paragraph needs a beginning and ending element.
 Do not include unordered, ordered, or definition lists within a paragraph. -->

            <!-- PULLQUOTE - OPTIONAL -->
            <!-- You can use a <pullquote> element to highlight important text in a larger,
                 colored font.  Include the quote source only if someone other than
                 the author is being quoted. -->

            <p>This article will give you a foundation to connect the powerful langauge processing capabilities of Watson to the songs and lyrics you love. We will start by authenticating with a Spotify account to retrieve playlists of popular songs, then fetching those song lyrics from <a href="http://genius.com">genius.com</a>, and finally using the Watson Developer Cloud to do fun and interesting things with the lyrics.</p>

            <p>In this installment of "Making Watson a Rock Star", we will use the Watson Language Translation service to translate the lyrics of popular songs into Spanish, to help English-speaking users improve their Spanish in a way that is fun, engaging, and memorable.</p>

                together</heading>
            <p>Okay, now we have all the parts in place to complete your
                app:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A basic Express app to serve up various pages</li>
                <li>A sentiment analysis function to assess the sentiment of
                    text</li>
                <li>A connection to Twitter to provide a source of tweets to
                    analyze</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Now we just need to combine them to do something interesting. The
                finished app will prompt the user for a phrase, call Twitter to
                open a stream filtered on the phrase, analyze the sentiment of
                each matching tweet, and create a page to monitor the sentiment
                over time.</p>

            <p>Keeping the user interface very simple, Listing 7 shows the full
                application, in all its Old School Struts-style glory:</p>

            <p>We’ve finally put something at the root path of the app as
                Listing 7 shows. The first time through, the app presents a
                welcome prompt and gathers a phrase to monitor. It then sets up
                the monitoring stream and presents a results page. The tweeter’s
                stream callback is updated to pass the tweet contents through
                the sentiment function, increment the tweet count, and record
                the sentiment. Non-English tweets are filtered out.</p>

            <p>For presentation purposes, the app uses the
                <code>sentimentImage()</code> function, which returns an image
                URL for a given sentiment value. The ranges for happy and grumpy
                are arbitrary. I found the range of sentiment to be surprisingly
                narrow for most topics, maybe due to the relative shortness of
                tweets. Feel free to play with these ranges.</p>

            <p>So let’s give it a try. Here are the results of a few test
                runs:</p>

            <figure>
                <heading refname="">Twittersphere is positive about Justin
                    Bieber</heading>

                    height="244" src="fig7.jpg" width="208"/>
            </figure>

            <figure>
                <heading refname="">Twittersphere is ambivalent about
                    Syria</heading>

                    alt="Neutral face icon expressing neutral sentiment for the topic                          'Syria' and the number of tweets analzyed (5)"
                    height="242" src="fig9.jpg" width="205"/>
            </figure>

                    Manning, PRISM</heading>

                    height="245" src="fig8.jpg" width="222"/>
            </figure>

            <heading type="h2" refname="tools" back-to-top="no"
                inline-commenting-id="cmt_8">Additional tooling
                considerations</heading>

            <p>In Step 1, I showed how you can use the <code>node</code> and
                <code>npm</code> commands to manage and run the application. You
                can easily do all of the coding with a text editor. However, in
                developing the app, I actually used a couple of other tools to
                ease my development.</p>

            <p>Also, I ultimately wanted to push the app to a Cloud
                Foundry-compatible Node.js runtime environment, such as <a
                    href="http://www.cloudfoundry.com">CloudFoundry.com</a> or
                IBM’s emerging <a
                    href="http://www.ibm.com/software/ebusiness/jstart/bluemix/index.html "
                    >BlueMix platform</a>. So the final app includes a few extra
                files required for that environment: the manifest.yml file
                describes the app and its resource needs to the Cloud Foundry
                runtime, and the npm-shrinkwrap.json files tell the Cloud
                Foundry Node.js runtime exactly which modules the app should be
                deployed with.</p>

            <heading refname="" type="h2" back-to-top="no"
                inline-commenting-id="cmt_9">Conclusion</heading>

            <p>In developing this app using Node.js, Express, ntwitter, and
                sentiment, I got a real appreciation for how easy it is to
                consume capabilities like Twitter access and sentiment analysis
                when they are packaged as Node.js modules. It’s easy to see why
                Node.js is so popular for developing web and mobile apps.</p>

            <p>I'm now curious to try using Express to add a more professional
                user interface to the app. I think there's plenty of room to
                improve it. ; )</p>
