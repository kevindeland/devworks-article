        <abstract>Build a Node.js application to connect to your Spotify account, fetch song lyrics from Genius.com, and then use Watson APIs to do fun things with those lyrics. This article includes a demo, sample code, and full
            instructions for authenticating with Spotify, then fetching lyrics,  and connecting to the Watson APIs on Bluemix.

        <!-- INTRODUCTORY VIDEO - OPTIONAL 
 For authors:  Optionally, develop a short video of yourself introducing the app you wrote 
 and perhaps demonstrating it on your computer or mobile device.  Send the video source 
 to your developerWorks editor.
 For editors:  If the author submits a video, follow the separate instructions on adding a
 thumbnail image, transcript, and closed-captions for the video on the developerWorks 
 YouTube channel. -->

        <!-- START OF ARTICLE BODY   
For authors: Your article can contain paragraphs, major headings, minor
headings, code listings, images, tables, sidebars, lists, highlighting, and 
"quoted" content in a larger font ("pull quotes"). 

DO NOT copy or cut and paste text from word processors such as 
Microsoft Word. The encoding method they use (even if UTF-8) creates 
invalid characters in the XML. Instead, save the Word document 
as a text file and then copy the text.  -->

            <!--For authors: On writing style. As you compose your article, aim for a
conversational style, including the purpose of the app, why you chose the tools, 
frameworks, languages, etc. you did, and how you developed the app, including 
relevant instructional information about the tools, frameworks, languages, etc. 
you used.  Don't overdo it.  You can make assumptions that the reader has some 
level of these skills, and should state those assumptions in the article.  Your purpose 
should be to teach a fellow developer how to develop a similar app using services 
in BlueMix and how to contribute to further development of your app on JazzHub.  
You should present your material in easy-to-follow steps and include relevant 
screen captures and code snippets.  Short, to-the-point articles are best.  We can 
string multiple articles together in an easy-to-consume set, if necessary.-->

            <!-- PARAGRAPH 
 For authors: Every paragraph needs a beginning and ending element.
 Do not include unordered, ordered, or definition lists within a paragraph. -->

            <!-- PULLQUOTE - OPTIONAL -->
            <!-- You can use a <pullquote> element to highlight important text in a larger,
                 colored font.  Include the quote source only if someone other than
                 the author is being quoted. -->

            <p>This article will give you a foundation to connect the powerful langauge processing capabilities of Watson to the songs and lyrics you love. We will start by authenticating with a Spotify account to retrieve playlists of popular songs, then fetching those song lyrics from <a href="http://genius.com">genius.com</a>, and finally using the Watson Developer Cloud to do fun and interesting things with the lyrics.</p>

            <p>In this installment of "Making Watson a Rock Star", we will use the Watson Language Translation service to translate the lyrics of popular songs into Spanish, to help English-speaking users improve their Spanish in a way that is fun, engaging, and memorable.</p>

            <p>To add your own Playlist, you need two fields:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Sentiment Analysis -- track the overall sentiments of songs, and then generate playlists which cater to a certain mood.</li>
              <li>Concept Insights -- extract what concepts artists are singing about, and contrast and compare them.</li>
              <li>Relationship Extraction (Alchemy API) -- find relationships between subjects, actions, and objects in songs, and build a database of lyrics tools to generate new songs.</li>
